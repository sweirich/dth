Capturing the constraints of perfect trees using the "finally tagless"
approach. This version uses a technique popularized in:

   Finally Tagless, Partially Evaluated
   Tagless Staged Interpreters for Simpler Typed Languages
   Jacques Carette, Oleg Kiselyov and Chung-chieh Shan
   JFP 2009

However, the idea itself is much older:

   See for example:

   Metacircularity in the polymorphic Î»-calculus.
   Pfenning, Frank, and Peter Lee. 1991. 
   Theoretical Computer Science 89(1):137â€“159

   Encoding types in ML-like languages. Yang. ICFP 1998

For a modern take on this practice, see:

   Folding Domain-Specific Languages: Deep and Shallow Embeddings (Functional Pearl)
   Jeremy Gibbons Nicolas Wu
   ICFP 2014
